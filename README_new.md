# MacDeepTranscriber - macOS Speech Recognition App

**The application uses only Apple Speech for speech recognition.** The architecture has been simplified to focus on one reliable recognition engine.

## Features

- **Apple Speech Recognition** - built-in macOS speech recognition
- **Multilingual support** - support for all Apple Speech languages
- **Transcription history** - automatic saving of all history
- **Named recordings** - save recordings with custom names
- **Data export** - easy access to transcription JSON files
- **AI integration** - transcription analysis using GLM-4

## Requirements

- macOS 11.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- Microphone access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "MacDeepTranscriber"
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open "MacDeepTranscriber.xcodeproj"
```

3. Run the project (âŒ˜+R)

## Quick Start

1. **Check microphone permissions**: Make sure the app has permission to access the microphone in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone

2. **Select language**: In settings, choose the desired language for Apple Speech recognition

3. **Start recording**: Click "Start Capture" to begin recording and recognition

## Features

### Apple Speech Recognition
- Built-in macOS speech recognition engine
- Support for multiple languages and locales
- Real-time mode
- High accuracy for supported languages
- No internet connection required after initial setup

### Transcriptions
- **Session history**: Shows transcriptions from current recording session
- **Persistent history**: All transcriptions saved to JSON files
- **Named recordings**: Save recordings with custom names
- **Export**: Easy access to JSON files through Finder

### AI Integration
- GLM-4-Flash for fast transcription analysis and processing
- Gemini 2.0 Flash for advanced analysis with large context
- Universal AI service for various providers
- AI-powered word learning

## Usage Recommendations

### Audio Settings
- For better quality: use a good USB microphone
- For maximum quality: ensure a quiet environment without echo

### Language Selection
- Choose the language that matches your speech
- Apple Speech works best with languages it was trained for

## Data Storage

All transcriptions are automatically saved to:
- `~/Documents/apple_history.json` - general history
- `~/Documents/apple_history_session.json` - session history
- `~/Documents/Recordings/` - named recordings

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues
1. Check permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone
2. Ensure the microphone is not being used by other applications
3. Try switching the input audio device in System Preferences > Sound > Input

### Recognition Issues
1. Make sure the selected language matches your speech
2. Speak clearly and not too fast
3. Ensure good audio quality (minimal noise)

### AI Chat Setup

To use the AI Chat feature, you'll need an API key from Zhipu AI:

1. Register at [https://open.bigmodel.cn/](https://open.bigmodel.cn/)
2. Get an API key in the API Keys section
3. In the app, click the key icon (ðŸ”‘) in AI Chat
4. Enter your API key
5. Start chatting with AI!
